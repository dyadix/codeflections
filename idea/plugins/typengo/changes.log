- '+', '-', '{' and '}' can be used in abbreviations.

- '+' and '-' at the end allow a command to be repeated without closing TypeNGo window. For example, 's+' (the default
  to expand a selection) you can continue pressing '+' to expand it further.

- More default commands:

  s+    Expand a selection
  s-    Narrow a selection
  fn+   Increas font size in editor
  fn-   Decreas font size in editor
  m{    Move cursor to the beginning of the block
  m}    MOve cursor to the end of the block
  s{    Move cursor to the beginning of the block with selection
  s}    Move cursor to the end of the block with selection
